<p>I'm a career changer, with 15 years of sales experience and hold a PhD in Semitic Languages. My former vocation is going to get automated away and I believe obtaining the skills of a web developer will create satisfying opportunities for myself and family, and allow my to give back meaningfully to the communities of which I'm a part.</p>
