I had several reasons for taking the plunge, quitting my job, applying to a coding bootcamp, and dedicating 5 months learning software engineering and web development. Professionally, I've been in a sales environment the past 15 years, and that environment began to scare me. I can see automation and technology facilitating more of the sales process (a good thing for the most part). Projecting out, I could see my job disappearing in the next 5-10 years. Not the position I want to be in during my mid-40s. A career change sounds painful, but I know the longer I wait the more painful and difficult it will be. So I made the commitment this year to start a career in software and web development.

This decision wasn't made overnight. I've been thinking on it for about a year. And this decision wasn't made in a vacuum either. I started thinking about other jobs to transition to and how to look out for my family. 

Real estate agent? Nope. Going extinct. Zillow, Redfin, and other online brokerages will replace live realtors.

Car salesman?

They're already history. Trucking? Autonomous vehicles will oust 2,000,000 of these jobs in about 15 years. I started making a list of jobs I thought would be gone in the next 10 years, in order to avoid them. This might sound odd, but I started thinking about how I'd use this list to help guide my children. How else could I help guide my children as they grow and start their careers? Web development and software engineering is booming and not going anywhere soon. Its skills and principles could likely be applied elsewhere in computer science and the tech world. But I don't have a clue how to help them here. None of my family has a tech background. 

Why not trailblaze for them? Why not make a high-risk decision, like the Pilgrims crossing the Atlantic, and give up your former life in order to give your kids new opportunities and a better life? So Flatiron School is my Mayflower, and we've cast off. I'm optimistic and hopeful, not simply for obtaining a better career and quality of life, but more for the path I think I can start for my kids. I hope that we can encourage others when we see that we have made the journey, and I'm excited to find ways to help others make that trans-Atlantic voyage as well. I'm looking forward to the ways I can help others with these new programming skills, such as assist food pantries and urban gardens in Detroit with their websites or supply chain, and use my abilities constructively to improve all of our lives.
